# Panoptic-Segmentation
Implemented an end-to-end transformer based model (DETR) for the task of Panoptic segmentation.

Given Sequence: 

![Image_seq](https://github.com/aryaman-patel/DETR-PS/assets/117113574/3c35eb87-7664-4dcd-b81a-b21606deb954)

Current output of the model:

TODO: 
[] Extend this model for instance matching over sequences of images, i.e. Video Panoptic segmentation
